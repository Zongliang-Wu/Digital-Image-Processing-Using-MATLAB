# Digital-Image-Processing-Using-MATLAB
“Digital Image Processing” Workshop - Based on Digital Image Processing Book by Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods
Digital image processing course by SIP Lab Under Supervision of Mr. Faghihi (who is one of the PhD lab members). This course introduces basic concepts and methodologies applicable to digital image processing, and to develop a foundation that can be used as the basis for further study and research in this field based on Digital Image Processing Book by Rafael C. Gonzalez.
